## 🎯 What is MediaQL?

**MediaQL** is a modern, declarative query language designed specifically for multimedia content. Think SQL for images, videos, audio, and documents—but with AI-powered semantic understanding built in.

```sql
-- Find similar product images
SELECT * FROM media 
WHERE SIMILAR_TO('/uploads/product.jpg', threshold=0.8) 
  AND CONTAINS_OBJECT('shoe', confidence >= 0.9)
ORDER BY similarity_score DESC;

-- Search videos by spoken content
SELECT * FROM media 
WHERE CONTAINS_SPEECH('machine learning tutorial') 
  AND duration BETWEEN 300 AND 1800;
```

## 🔥 The Problem We Solve

**Current Pain Points:**

- Searching multimedia requires complex ML pipelines and custom code
- No unified way to query across images, videos, audio, and documents
- Existing solutions (SQL/MM, MPEG-7) are outdated and developer-unfriendly
- Teams waste months building custom search infrastructure

**MediaQL Makes It Simple:** One query language for all multimedia content with built-in AI understanding.

## ⚡ Key Features

### 🧠 **AI-Powered Content Understanding**

- **Object Detection**: Find images/videos containing specific objects
- **OCR & Text Extraction**: Search text within images and documents
- **Audio Transcription**: Query spoken content in audio/video files
- **Semantic Similarity**: Find content similar to examples or descriptions

### 🔍 **Rich Query Capabilities**

- **Metadata Filtering**: File type, size, duration, creation date
- **Spatio-Temporal**: Time ranges in videos, bounding boxes in images
- **Cross-Modal Search**: Text-to-image, image-to-video, audio-to-text
- **Query-by-Example**: Upload a file and find similar content

### 🚀 **Developer-Friendly**

- **SQL-Inspired Syntax**: Familiar `SELECT-FROM-WHERE` structure
- **No ML Expertise Required**: AI models work behind the scenes
- **REST API**: Easy integration with existing applications
- **Real-Time Results**: Sub-second response times

## 🏗️ Architecture

MediaQL is a **query engine** that orchestrates multiple databases:

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│   MediaQL Engine    │ ← Your Application
├─────────────────────┤
│ PostgreSQL │ Vector │ ← Metadata & Embeddings
│    S3      │ Cache  │ ← Files & Performance
└─────────────────────┘
```

**Not a Database**: MediaQL translates multimedia queries into optimized operations across specialized storage systems.

## 🚀 Get Started

### Quick Example

```sql
-- Find all invoices from last month
SELECT * FROM documents 
WHERE CONTAINS_TEXT('invoice') 
  AND created_date >= '2024-12-01';

-- Discover similar product images
SELECT *, SIMILARITY_SCORE as score
FROM products 
WHERE SIMILAR_TO_TEXT('red running shoes') 
ORDER BY score DESC LIMIT 10;
```

### Integration

```python
import mediaql

# Initialize client
client = mediaql.Client('your-api-key')

# Execute query
results = client.query("""
    SELECT * FROM media 
    WHERE CONTAINS_OBJECT('person', confidence >= 0.8)
    LIMIT 20
""")
```
